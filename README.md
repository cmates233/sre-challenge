# sre-challenge

I am pleased to submit the project for your review, which covers three main components:

- Infrastructure – Implemented using Terraform, designed to provide a resilient, scalable, and compliant multi-region architecture on Google Cloud.
- Application – A simple Go-based service containerized and deployed via Cloud Build and GKE, following CI/CD best practices.
- Security – A detailed analysis and set of recommendations, ensuring security is integrated throughout the system’s lifecycle.

This submission aims to demonstrate an end-to-end approach to infrastructure automation, deployment reliability, and security-by-design principles.
